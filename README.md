# vue3-starter

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. Also includes Vue Router, Tailwind, FontAwesome 6 and ESLint with Prettier.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:

- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

### Opinionated VS Code Settings

This repository includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file which ensures code formatting is kept consistent. It does this by enabling "format on save", "fix all on save" and ensuring `Prettier` is set as the formatter.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
